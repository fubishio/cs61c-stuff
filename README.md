proj2-1 MIPS Assembler - two pass assembler that translates MIPS to machine code   
proj2-2 MIPS Linker - processes output files and makes an executable file by combining the code and creating a symbol table  
proj3-1 ALU and RegFile - logisim project where registers and arithmetic logic unit is designed  
proj3-2 CPU - logisim project where I created a functioning mips cpu that took in and understood mips instructions  
proj4 Performance Optimization - optimized depth map generator algorithm using SIMD, OpenMP, and loop unrolling  
proj5-1 PageRank With Spark - implemented [PageRank](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html) algorithm in the Spark framework
